# Twitch Gaming Data Analysis with SQL
Twitch provided this dataset to Codecademy to be used in the platform's 'Analyze Data with SQL' skill path. Analyzing gaming data was particularly interesting to me because I know very little about the subject, thus getting to practice data analysis on a subject I am not familiar with.

It was important for me to inspect all columns of the dataset to gain an understanding about the stream and chat functions on Twitch and how they connect the global gaming community.

I used SQLite to explore the dataset and gain further insights into the data. My SQL queries are saved as an .sql file in this folder.
