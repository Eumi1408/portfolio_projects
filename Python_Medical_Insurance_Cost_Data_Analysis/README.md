# U.S. Medical Insurance Data Analysis with Jupyter
This project uses a fictional dataset in csv format created by Codecademy that I used to practice my data analytics skills with Python (right before I learned how to use Pandas and NumPy). I loaded the patient data into a main dictionary which can then be sliced into different subsets of data if desired via a function. The class I built uses a dictionary of patient data as an input, creates lists with the data of each column, and offers methods to explore descriptive statistics as well as answer more specific analytics questions.
In the Jupyter Notebook, I also note some issues with the distribution of the data and list possible directions for further research.
