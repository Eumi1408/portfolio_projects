#  Data Visualization Dashboard on Tableau Public about 2015 U.S. Airplane and Wildlife Collisions
As part of the "Data Visualization with Tableau" course on Codecademy, I created a summary dashboard on Tableau Public. Codecademy provided a shortened dataset of the original data curated by the Federal Aviation Administration in csv format so that the data could be used with the free version of Tableau. I practiced using different types of visualizations, formatting, labeling, color themes, annotations, dimensions vs. attributes vs. measures, and more.
