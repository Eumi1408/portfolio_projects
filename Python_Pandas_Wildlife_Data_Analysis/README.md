# U.S. National Park Biodiversity Data Analysis & Visualization with Python & Jupyter Notebook
This project cleans, analyzes, and presents a dataset of wildlife observations in four U.S. National Parks: Bryce Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone, and Yosemite using Python. After formatting the data to explore it, I use it to investigate five research questions around conserved and threatened species, animal categories, and more specifically mammals in each of the parks. I present my findings along with the corresponding code in this Jupyter Notebook.

While Codecademy Pro provided me with this dataset as a project in the BI Data Analyst Career Path, I wrote all of the code and text completely on my own.
