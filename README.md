### 01 Python/Sklearn Linear Regression Model on Cereal Serving Sizes
Cap'n Crunch can eat a bunch - but should we? In this notebook, I load the dataset based on my own hands-on research from a study I co-authored and published as part of an internship at Cornell University and an independent study at Dickinson College. I implement a linear regression machine learning model with sklearn to show the relationship between depicted vs. suggested serving size. I found that the portion size displayed on the box has about twice as many calories as the suggested serving size on the nutrition facts label on the back. This difference combined with the power of visual cues compared to numbers may lead to unintentional overconsumption.

### 02 Python/Pandas Data Analysis of Biodiversity in U.S. National Parks
In this Jupyter Notebook, I clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset of wildlife observations in four U.S. National Parks: Bryce Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone, and Yosemite using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. Did you know that these parks have over 5000 scientific species of plants and animals in common?

### 03 Python Recipe Recommendation Engine
I built a simple recipe recommendation engine using stacks as the data structure and merge sort as the sorting algorithm. Some of my favorite dishes are organized by category and displayed based on the user's interests, subsequently getting popped off the stack. Once the stack of a given category is empty, the user is prompted to select other categories - it is important to have a balanced diet!

### 04 Python Medical Insurance Cost Data Analysis
This project uses a fictional dataset in csv format created by Codecademy that I used to practice my data analytics skills with Python (right before I learned how to use Pandas). After walking the reader through my analysis, I note some issues with the distribution of the data and list possible directions for further research.

### 05 SQL Data Analysis of Twitch Gaming Data
I had no idea what Twitch was all about until I worked with this dataset provided by the company. Using SQLite to explore the dataset and gain further insights, I gain an understanding about the stream and chat functions on Twitch and how they connect the global gaming community.

### 06 Tableau Public Data Visualization Dashboard about 2015 U.S. Airplane and Wildlife Collisions
I created a summary dashboard on Tableau Public. Codecademy provided the a shortened dataset of the original data curated by the Federal Aviation Administration in csv format so that the data could be used with the free version of Tableau. I practiced using different types of visualizations, formatting, labeling, color themes, annotations, dimensions vs. attributes vs. measures, and more.
