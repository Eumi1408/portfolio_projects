# CS_102_Portfolio_Project
For Codecademy's CS 102 final project of the Computer Science Career Path, I built a simple recipe recommendation engine using stacks as the data structure and merge sort as the sorting algorithm. Dishes are organized by category and displayed based on the user's interests, subsequently getting popped off the stack. Once the stack of a given category is empty, the user is prompted to select other categories.

I would like to note that there was no significant use case to display all recipes in alphabetical order at the beginning of a recommendation round or to have a LIFO setup for the recipe categories. The goal was to practice using a data structure along with a sorting algorithm. Lists per category (perhaps in alphabetical order) that could then be joined together for a full list of available dishes would have done the job as well. For more practice, for example, I could also use queues instead of stacks and bubble sort or quicksort instead of merge sort.
